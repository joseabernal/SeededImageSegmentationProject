\subsection{Detailed Description}
This factory class is in charge of generating instances of the Neighbourhoods. There are basically two types of neighbourhoods N8 (8 neighbours) and N4 (4 neighbours).

This enum represents the possible neighbourhood types that can be build using this factory class. Using N8 will create a 8-\/neighbours and N4 a 4-\/neighbours.
