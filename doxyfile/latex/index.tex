The seeded segmentation implementation presented in this project is based on the paper "Laplacian Coordinates for Seeded Image Segmentation, W. Casaca, L.\-G. Nonato, G. Taubin. I\-E\-E\-E Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (I\-E\-E\-E C\-V\-P\-R 2014), I\-E\-E\-E Press, pp. 384-\/391, 2014".

\subsection*{System requirements}

The following libraries should be correctly installed in the system in order to compile the source code\-: Linux (preferred) Qt $>$= 4.\-8.\-0 Eigen $>$= 3.\-2.\-0 Open\-C\-V $>$= 2.\-4.\-8 Pkg-\/config $>$= 0.\-26 G\-Test $>$= 1.\-6.\-1 C\-Make $>$= 3.\-2.\-0

\subsection*{Compilation}

\subsubsection*{Linux}

To compile the source code, the following steps should be followed\-: Open the console in the folder containing the project. Run qmake -\/project to generate the Makefile. Verify that the Makefile is created. Run make. Verify that there is no error while compiling and also that a Seeded\-Image\-Segmentation\-Project file is created. To run the application, you should run ./\-Seeded\-Image\-Segmentation\-Project
